This project has been imported on 2015/05/11 from:
https://code.google.com/p/ethernetip4j/
I have no informations about the original project authors, the only info i have are the "shortened" email addressess available on google code:
maja.arv...@gmail.com 	Owner
sewallin...@gmail.com 	Owner
jens.fre...@gmail.com 	Owner
carlosl...@gmail.com 	Committer
teknobr...@gmail.com  Committer
I will update this informations and give proper credit for their work if i manage to get their names.

The project on google code is dead and the latest patches i made available on google code issue tracker have never been merged in the project trunk.
So now i am starting this new project where i have applied all my patches.

Please note that i am mantaining this project because i need it at work.
However my knowledge of the protocol and the library itself is very limited, also i do not have access to the full documentation of the ethernet/ip and cip protocols.
The modifications i have dove are the result of a very difficult and tedious process of bug hunting, documentation hunting, trial and error and luck.

So i can't assure prompt bugfixing or proper development of this project unless i need to solve the same issue formy work.
Good luck and have fun!
